👋 Welcome to My Repository!

Hi there, and thank you for stopping by!
This repository contains my laboratory works for the course “Modeling and Analysis of Information Systems” — part of my studies in software engineering.
Here you’ll find projects that demonstrate my progress in understanding software architecture, system modeling, and programming principles.

🧩 About This Repository

Each folder inside represents a separate laboratory work (LW1, LW2, LW3, LW4, etc.), covering different stages of software system analysis and development — from conceptual UML design to the implementation of full-featured C# and ASP.NET Core Web API projects.

The repository reflects not just code, but also the analytical process:
how a system is modeled, designed, implemented, and tested.
Every lab includes diagrams, explanations, and examples that help visualize the logic behind the solution.

🚀 Learning Goals

Through these works, I aim to:

Strengthen my understanding of object-oriented programming in C#

Practice building structured UML diagrams (Use Case, Class, Activity)

Learn how to develop and validate Web APIs with ASP.NET Core

Apply data modeling and validation techniques (DataAnnotations, FluentValidation)

Improve teamwork, documentation, and version control skills using Git & GitHub

💡 Technologies and Tools

Languages: C# (.NET 8), SQL

Frameworks: ASP.NET Core Web API

Modeling: UML (draw.io, PlantUML)

Validation: DataAnnotations, FluentValidation

Version Control: Git, GitHub

IDE: Visual Studio, VS Code 
✨ Final Note

This repository is a reflection of my journey as a student and aspiring developer.
Each project represents not just a completed assignment but also a step toward mastering clean code, structured thinking, and real-world development practices.

If you’re viewing this repository — thank you!
I hope it inspires or helps you in your own learning path.
